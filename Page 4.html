  <h2> Orton Gillingham for Teaching Students with Dyslexia </h2>
  <p> Recently, I took a 60 hour course in an approach to tutoring students with dyslexia, and I'm working on a practicum so that I can be certified to tutor students. A summary of this approach is students with dyslexia and other reading difficulties must be taught phonics with a direct, systematic, cumulative and multisensory approach. Teachers must start with the letters of the alphabet and their multitude of sounds. They should start with one-to-one grapheme â€“ phoneme and build to more complicated aspects. Next steps should include recognizing and reproducing letters in words and words in sentences. Phonics instruction is inextricably tied to spelling instruction.
