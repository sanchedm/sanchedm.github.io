  <h2> Orton Gillingham Approach for Teaching Students with Dyslexia </h2>
  <p> <article> Recently, I took a 60 hour course in an approach to tutoring students with dyslexia, and I'm working on a practicum so that I can be certified to tutor students. A summary of this approach is students with dyslexia and other reading difficulties <em> must </em> be taught phonics with a direct, systematic, cumulative and multisensory approach. Samuel Orton was...Anna Gillingham was...Teachers must start with the letters of the alphabet and their multitude of sounds. They should start with one-to-one grapheme â€“ phoneme and build to more complicated aspects. Next steps should include recognizing and reproducing letters in words and words in sentences. Phonics instruction is inextricably tied to spelling instruction.

  Unlike speech, which is acquired naturally as long as a child is exposed to comprehensible input, reading <em>must </em> be taught.

  <p> Dr. Stanislaus Dehaene, cognitive neuroscientist, explains how the brain learns to read.
