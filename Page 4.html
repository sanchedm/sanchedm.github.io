  <h2> Orton Gillingham Approach for Teaching Students with Dyslexia </h2>
  <p> <article> Recently, I took a 60 hour course in an approach to tutoring students with dyslexia, and I'm working on a practicum so that I can be certified to tutor students. A summary of this approach is students with dyslexia and other reading difficulties <em> must </em> be taught phonics with a direct, systematic, cumulative and multisensory approach. Samuel Orton was...Anna Gillingham was...Teachers must start with the letters of the alphabet and their multitude of sounds. They should start with one-to-one grapheme â€“ phoneme and build to more complicated aspects. Next steps should include recognizing and reproducing letters in words and words in sentences. Phonics instruction is inextricably tied to spelling instruction.

  <p> The clip above is a demonstration of how a student can practice syllibication with a multisensory tool. </p> </article>

   <h2>How does the brain learn to read? </h2> 
  Unlike speech, which is acquired naturally as long as a child is exposed to comprehensible input, reading <em>must </em> be taught.

  <p> Dr. Stanislaus Dehaene, cognitive neuroscientist, explains how the brain learns to read in the above video. <aside> (I disagree with one thing he says - that parents from lower socio-economic families need to talk to their kids more.  This is a myth that they talk to their kids less. They talk to them just as much as other families - it's just that the words they use aren't valued as much as words that middle class families use. He shouldn't present this comment outside of a critique of the unequal society in which kids are learning to read.) <aside>
