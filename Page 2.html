  <h1> My Work/Educational History </h1>
      <p> I've been an educator for the last 15 years. My 1st teaching job was as an ESL teacher for 6,7 and 8th grade, and I did that for 3 years. In 2003, I started a Master's program in Secondary English Education. While I was in that program, I also earned a license to teach ELA to 7-12 grades. While my original plan was to teach high school, I only taught English 9 and 10 for a year. While I was earning a Master's, I taught college transitional English (also known as basic writing) and ESL to international undergraduates. I decided not to teach high school and instead pursued a doctorate in Literacy and Second Language Studies. While I was pursuing an Ed.D. at the University of Cincinnati, I continued teaching basic writing at the university's open access program, called the Center for Access and Transition. Unfortunately, the Center, where many underserved students took classes, closed. (You can read more about that history in "The Life and Death and Life of a College, a Department, & a Basic Writing Program" by Gibson & Meem, 2008)
